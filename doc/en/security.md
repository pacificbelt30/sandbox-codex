Security principles, container configuration, and known limitations of codex-dock.

## Core Principle: Never Pass Secrets to Containers

codex-dock's security is built on the principle of **never passing real credentials directly to containers**.

```
                    BAD (conventional approach)
┌────────────┐                           ┌──────────────────┐
│   Host     │  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx   │    Container     │
│            │─────────────────────────▶│  (risk: leakage) │
└────────────┘                           └──────────────────┘

                    GOOD (codex-dock approach)
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Host                                                      │
│                                                             │
│  API Key ──▶ Auth Proxy ──▶ Placeholder ──▶ Container     │
│  (protected)               (cdx-xxxx, TTL-scoped)          │
│               │                                             │
│               │ Injects real Authorization header           │
│               │ on every outbound request                   │
│               ▼                                             │
│          api.openai.com / chatgpt.com                       │
│                                                             │
│  · Real API Key / access_token never reaches container      │
│  · Container only holds a placeholder (cdx-xxxx)           │
│  · Placeholder cannot be used to access OpenAI directly     │
│  · OAuth refresh_token is held by host only                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Container Security Settings

Each sandbox container has the following security settings applied:

| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--cap-drop ALL` | Drop all Linux capabilities | Prevents privilege escalation and privileged operations |
| `--security-opt no-new-privileges` | Prohibit new privilege acquisition | Prevents setuid/setgid binary abuse |
| `USER codex (uid:1000)` | Run as non-root user | Prevents root-level host operations |
| `--pids-limit 512` | Limit maximum processes to 512 | Prevents fork bombs and similar attacks |
| Network: per-worker `Internal` net | A dedicated isolated network per worker | Blocks worker↔worker, worker→host, and worker→internet (egress is proxy-only) |

---

## Defense-in-Depth Structure

```
[Layer 1: Credential Protection]
  API Key / OAuth tokens → held by Auth Proxy
  Containers receive only short-lived placeholders
        │
        ▼
[Layer 2: Process Privilege Restriction]
  --cap-drop ALL + no-new-privileges + non-root execution
  Malicious behavior inside container cannot easily affect host
        │
        ▼
[Layer 3: Network Isolation (Docker-native)]
  Per-worker Internal network (no NAT / no host route)
  Worker↔worker blocked by separate L2 segments; egress only via the proxy (router)
  No iptables/sudo; same on macOS / Windows
        │
        ▼
[Layer 4: Resource Limits]
  --pids-limit 512 prevents fork bombs and similar attacks
```

## Implemented Protections

| Protection | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| API key isolation | ✅ | Container receives only placeholder; proxy injects real key |
| access_token isolation | ✅ | Real access token never reaches container even in OAuth mode |
| refresh_token protection | ✅ | Never sent to container; proxy handles refresh |
| Short-lived tokens | ✅ | TTL-scoped; immediately revoked on container stop |
| API traffic relay | ✅ | Reverse proxy eliminates direct external API access |
| No credential logging | ✅ | Auth info never written to stdout/stderr |
| Worker↔worker blocking | ✅ | Per-worker `Internal` network (separate L2 segments); no iptables |
| Worker→host/internet blocking | ✅ | `Internal: true` (no NAT/host route); egress only via the proxy. Same on macOS / Windows |
| Privilege escalation prevention | ✅ | `--cap-drop ALL` + `--security-opt no-new-privileges` |
| Non-root execution | ✅ | `USER codex (uid:1000)` |
| Resource limits | ✅ | `--pids-limit 512` |

## Known Issues

| ID | Issue | Severity | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| NF-SEC-01 | Auth Proxy uses plaintext HTTP | High | TLS/UNIX socket not implemented; designed for Docker internal use only |
| ~~F-NET-02~~ | (Resolved) container-to-host blocking was Linux-specific | — | Moved to Docker `Internal` networks; Docker enforces the blocking on all platforms (no iptables). |
| F-AUTH-06 | No container ID verification | Medium | Token tied to container name but not container ID |
